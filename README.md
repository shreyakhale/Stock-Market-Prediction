# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM

## Project Description

This project leverages Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict and forecast stock market prices. Developed as part of a data science internship, the project focuses on collecting, processing, and analyzing historical stock data to provide insights into future price movements. The implementation utilizes technologies such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn for building and evaluating the predictive model.

The key steps of the project include data collection, preprocessing, feature scaling, model creation, performance evaluation, and future price prediction. The code offers a detailed walkthrough, ensuring transparency in the methodology used. The visualizations aid in understanding the trends, while the Stacked LSTM model showcases its effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.
