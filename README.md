# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

I have made this project as a a part of my data science internship at @LetsGrowMore (LGM).

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.
The steps followed are :
-Stock dataset collection.
-Preprocessing of the data- train & test.
[Normalize the dataset converting the share values to a range between 0 and 1. This will be useful for training and testing the dataset.
Also, train & test the data using the last 25% of the dataset, which was set aside for this purpose.]
-Creation of the stacked LSTM (Long short-term memory) model.
-Prediction and checking of performance.
-Calculation the performance.
-Prediction for next 30 days. 
[Ploting last 130 days closing Price along with the graph with predicted 30 days output.]
